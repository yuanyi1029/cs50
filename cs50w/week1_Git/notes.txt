------------------------------------- Git -------------------------------------
Version control tool used in the command line

Functions of Git:
1) Keep track of changes to code
2) Synchronize code between different people
3) Test changes to code without losing the original code
4) Revert back to old versions of code 

Git commands:
git clone <url>           Takes a repository on the internet and downloads it
git add <filename>        Adds a file for git to track the next time a commit happens 
git commit -m "message"   Keeps track of the changes of the added files, saves them as snapshots
git push                  Pushes the changes in the local repository up to the server 
git status                Informs the user on what is currently happening in the repository   
git pull                  Downloads the latest version of the repository
git log                   Shows all the changes that were made in a repository 
git reset --hard <commit> Reverts the current state of a repository to an older state

Merge conflicts happens when 2 users make changes in the same part of code 

---------------------------------- Branching ----------------------------------
Git Branches allows working on different parts of a repository at the same time
Git branches can be merged together once each of the branches are completed

Repositories may have these branches: 
1) Main branch (Default branch. Contains updated, stable version of the code)
2) Feature branch (Non-default branch. May contain code for new features)

Git commands for branching:
git branch                Shows all the available branches in a repository
git checkout -b <name>    Creates a new branch and switches to it
git checkout master       Switches to the master branch
git merge <name>          Merges a branch to the master branch                 

----------------------------- Forking Repositories ----------------------------
Git feature that allows users to copy a repository into their accounts which enables
users to clone the forked repository into their computer and make changes

A pull request can be sent to the owner when sizeable changes have been made

The owner can review the proposed changes and merge the user's code with the original
repository source code 

----------------------------------- Github ------------------------------------
Website that stores Git repositories

-------------------------------- Github Pages ---------------------------------
Free Github service that allows users to deploy their website onto the internet
