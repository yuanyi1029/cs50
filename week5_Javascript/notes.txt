---------------------------------- Javascript ----------------------------------
Client side programming language that enables interactive webpages by directly 
manipulating the Document Object Model (DOM) on a client's computer

Javascript is good at Event Driven Programming, which is programming based on 
events that happen on the web in which it responds to events by using event 
listeners and handlers 

A Javascript code is added into a HTML webpage code with <script> tags
Example:
    <script>
        // function (do something) 
    </script>

------------------- Application Programming Interface (API) -------------------
Well defined structured way for services on the internet to communicate with each
other
Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) often transfer data in Javascript objects,
specifically in Javascript Object Notation (JSON)

Example JSON syntax:
   {
      "key": value,
      "key": value,
      "key": value
   }
