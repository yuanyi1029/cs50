------------------------------------ HTML -------------------------------------
Markup Language used to describe the structure of a webpage
A HTML webpage code is just made up of tags and attributes

Example:
   <html lang="en">
      <!-- content -->
   </html>
<html> and </html> are opening and closing tags
lang="en" is an attribute that modifies the <html> tag


HTML elements (represented in tags) are structured in a tree-like structure
called Document Object Model (DOM). The DOM describes how each element are related
to each other
HTML Document Object Model (Based on 001_hello.html):
            html tag
    head tag        body tag
    title tag       Hello, world!
    Hello

------------------------------------- CSS -------------------------------------
Markup language used to style and format webpage content in which the CSS style
sheet code gives properties to HTML elements
HTML elemenets can also get style properties from parent elements based on the 
Document Object Model (DOM)

Example:
   body {
      text-align: center;
   }
   header {
      font-size: large;
   }
   .medium {
      font-size: medium;
   }
body and header defines attributes for the <body> and <header> tags respectively
while .medium defines attributes for the "medium" class

------------------------- CSS Selectors & Precendence -------------------------
CSS have different types of selectors when choosing HTML elements to style
CSS Selectors:
a, b                 (Multiple Element Selector)
a  b  OR  a > b      (Descendant Selector)(At 013_descendant.html)
a[attribute=""]      (Attribute Selector)(At 014_attribute.html)
a:b                  (Pseudoclass Selector)(At 015_hover.html)


CSS Selecity Precendence is required because different CSS style selectors may 
reference the same element
Example: 
   h1 {
      color: red;
   }
   #foo {
      color: blue;
   }
   <h1 id="foo">Hello World</h1>
How does "Hello World" get styled? Both h1 and foo are selected by CSS style 
selectors. (Answer: CSS Selecity Precedence is required)

CSS Selecity Precedence:
1. Inline styling    (Directly adding style="" to HTML elements)
2. Id styling        (Adding id="" to HTML elements)
3. Class styling     (Adding class="" to HTML elements)
4. Type styling      (Styling by the type of the HTML element)

---------------------------------- Bootstrap ----------------------------------
Pre-written CSS code (Called a library) used to style and format webpage content 
so users do not need to style webpages from scratch

------------------------------------ Sass -------------------------------------
Syntactically Awesome Style Sheets (Sass) is an extension to CSS Markup Language
that adds additional features to CSS to make it more powerful

Advantages:
Sass allows CSS to have variables
Sass makes CSS nesting easier to implement
Sass makes CSS inheritance easier to implement

Disadvantages:
Computers do not understand sass stylesheet files, a compiler is needed to convert
scss files into css files
